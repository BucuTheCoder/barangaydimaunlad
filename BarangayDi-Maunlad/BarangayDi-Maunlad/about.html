<h2> Barangay History </h2>
<p title="start">The name of the barangay Di-maunlad came from the words “Hindi maunlad” which means “not progressive” because the place was very poor and not prosperous. </p>
<p title="start">
The barangay was very prosperous back then because they have so many resources for their everyday lives. 
Their land is rich in nutrients where they can cultivate and grow plants and they also have plenty of animals where they can get their food everyday. 
The barangay lived a peaceful life until the Americans came and discovered the place.
</p>
<p title="start">
These American soldiers led by Douglas D. Maunland forced the residents of the barangay to surrender their resources and threatened their lives if they didn’t comply.
 The residents didn’t have any choice but to agree to their requests. The soldiers took over the place and made the residents their slaves. 
 Because of this, the residents didn’t have the time to cultivate their land and take care of their animals until one day  their resources were almost none. 
 The residents said “di na maunlad ang lugar na to” which means “this place is not prosperous anymore” and eventually named the place Barangay Di-Maunlad.
</p>
<p title="start">
However, one day, the residents got their place back by stealing the soldiers’ weapons and used them to make the soldiers leave the place. 
It took the residents years to regain their resources and made Barangay Di-Maunlad prosperous once again.
